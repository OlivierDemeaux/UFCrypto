## Idea
"Beyond Order Rule 7: Work as Hard as You Possibly Can on At Least One Thing and See What Happens" Jordan Peterson.

I'm a big fan of the UFC and MMA in general, so decided to try to create a blockchain game where fighters train and fight with other fighters and only the best make it to the UFC and can participate to the championship.
I still have no idea of the gameplay or any of the features I will implement.

Still is just an idea that I had, of making a fun crypto/blockchain game, where fighters are NFTs and they can fight, level up, train and improve, ...

Truth be told, I'm doing this to improve my coding skills while having fun and working on something that I want to work on.
 Don't know where this will lead
